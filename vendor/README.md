# The `vendor` Directory

This is the odd directory of MicrobeTrace dependencies that can't be bundled. for the Javascripts, this is probably because we need accessible to `importScripts` in Workers. For others, it's probably because of some CSS relative path shenanigans.

Either way, the contents of this directory are generated by copying stuff out of the `node_modules` directory. In spite of this fact, **these files *should* be committed to version control**. That way, we can create bare-bones deployments (a la Github Pages) from just the contents of the repo, while still retaining the power of NPM to manage our dependencies.
