# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported versions of MicrobeTrace are always the versions under the latest minor release. A Minor release bump signals
sunsetting of security support for older versions. Most users will not ever need to worry about this, as they'll be served the
newest production-released version of MicrobeTrace by default.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 0.5   | :x:                |
| [MicrobeTrace Desktop](https://github.com/CDCgov/MicrobeTrace-archive) | :x:   |
| WinHIVTRACE | :x:   |

Historical projects from which MicrobeTrace has evolved are NOT supported. Anyone using these is strongly encouraged to begin
using [MicrobeTrace](https://microbetrace.cdc.gov/MicrobeTrace/) instead.
